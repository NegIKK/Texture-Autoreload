# Description
A simple addon that updates all textures in the project after a certain period of time. Since the well-known addon is not updated for the last 2 years, with the help of AI this one was written to bring back the functionality of [Auto_Reload](https://github.com/samytichadou/Auto_Reload_Blender_addon) for blender 4.2


# Usage
- Checkbox whether auto-update is enabled 
- Slider responsible for the refresh rate in seconds

# Bugs
Not as fast as the well-known Auto_Reload. With heavy textures and a large number of them may lag. Use with caution
